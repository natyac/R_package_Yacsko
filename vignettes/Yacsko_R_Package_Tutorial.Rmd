```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installation

(Here we add the libraries used in this package)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```

(Now, we install our own R package)

```{r}
#devtools::install_github("natyac/R_Package_Yacsko")
```

(Final part- downloading data for our R package)

```{r}
download.file(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BiologicalDataAnalysis2019/2021/main/projects/project_one/data/FossilAnts.csv", destfile = "FossilAnts.csv")
Ants<-read_csv("/cloud/project/vignettes/FossilAnts.csv")
```

(Now we start the actual tutorial)

## Working example

+ An example of each function and how it works
+ Say something about why this is a good thing to do
+ Say something about expected output
(Do this for each function)

(Ex:)

```{r}
library(projectY)
TypesOfAnts <- AntsIn(Ants, Genus)
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# We used this function because we wanted to see how many different genera were represented in the experiment/data frame.
# We expect a list of genera to appear in one column, and a count of every time a genera to be in one column, and a count of every time a genera was listed in the Genus column of our original Ants data frame.
NAbegone <- cleanup("/cloud/project/R/Ants.csv")
view(NAbegone)
# This function was used to regenerate the original Ants free of NA and empty data values.
# This function should have outputted a new data frame free of NA-like values.
AntGraph <- AntHistory(Ants, min_ma)
AntGraph
# We wanted a graph to show us the era based on the minimum age when each ant was alive and what era had the most ants living in it.
# The expected output is a histogram that groups each ant by minimum age with a count of each ant/era. 
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r TypesOfAnts}
summary(TypesOfAnts)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r AntGraph, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
plot(AntGraph)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
